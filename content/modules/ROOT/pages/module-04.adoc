= Section 5 - Network Workflow
The workflow used in this Lab is called the **Network-AIOps-Workflow**. This workflow is triggered by Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) whenever an OSPF neighbor adjacency issue is detected by Splunk. Specifically, this lab is set up to respond to failed OSPF neighbors. The workflow will run specific playbook tasks depending on the cause of the OSPF neighbor downtime.

== Scenarios
The essence of the following scenarios is to empower a network expert to translate their manual OSPF troubleshooting rationale into intelligent, automated playbooks. Using a development pipeline, the expert creates and refines prompts for Ansible Lightspeed to generate the necessary automation code. To ensure safety and accuracy, a workflow allows the expert to first run each AI-generated playbook in check mode. This provides an opportunity to review and approve the proposed changes before they are applied to production. If a playbook doesn't work as intended, the expert can simply continue to refine their prompt in this iterative cycle until the desired outcome is achieved.

* Scenario-1: OSPF neighbor down due to interface shut 
* Scenario-2: OSPF neighbor down due to incorrect OSPF network type
* Scenario-3: OSPF neighbor down due to hello timer mismatch

== Scenario-1: OSPF neighbor down due to interface shut

In this first scenario we will cause an OSPF neighbor down by intentionally shutting down the OSPF interface (Tunnel0 on cisco-rtr1).

=== Step 1: Review the playbook (network_aiops.yml)

The playbook can be reviewed in its entirety here: https://github.com/ansible-tmm/aiops-summitlab/blob/main/playbooks/network_aiops.yml[network_aiops.yml on GitHub,window=_blank]

**Note:** The following snippets explain how this playbook uses the uri module and prompt variable to interact with Ansible Lightspeed AI to create an effective playbook for OSPF remediation. Not every task is explained in detail.

     run a new task that administratively enables interface for parent interface tunnel0 when stdout contains 'administratively down' 
----
In the above playbook snippet the network engineer is articulating the requirements for the playbook as a multi-line variable named `lightspeed_prompt`. This portion of the prompt is focused on scenario-1. Here we are asking for a playbook to identify when the OSPF interface is down and remediate with a `no shut`

The preceding tasks convert the AI response into a YAML playbook named `lightspeed-response.yml`. The final task then pushes this file to the Gitea repository, making the new playbook available for execution within the workflow.

Step 2: Access the terminal to Shut the OSPF interface

Step 4: Review the `Create Playbook AI` job-template

You can click on the icon and glean from the output the proposed playbook created by Ansible Lighspeed AI.

image::workflow_job_3.png[Workflow 1, 150%, link="_images/workflow_job_3.png", window="_blank"]

The tasks shown above were generated by Ansible Lightspeed in response to our prompt for remediating an OSPF down issue for scenario-1. The logic is straightforward: when a conditional task confirms the interface is administratively down, a subsequent task is run to re-enable it with the no shutdown command. The rest of the playbook has been truncated for brevity, as it pertains to later scenarios.

Step 5: Review the `lightspeed_response` playbook in the Gitea repository

You should see a recently updated file for `lightspeed-response.yml` in the `lightspeed-playbooks` repository. Now that this playbook is updated in the Gitea repo it becomes available to run in subsequent workflow steps.

[quote]
💡 **Important**: The AI-generated playbook content may vary from run to run based on how Ansible Lightspeed interprets the prompt. If the playbook in your Gitea repository doesn't exactly match what you expected, this is normal behavior. The key is to verify that the logic and tasks align with the remediation goal (bringing up the Tunnel0 interface when it's administratively down). You can review the playbook content before proceeding with the workflow execution.

Step 6: Review the `Playbook-Check-Mode` job-template in the workflow.

== Scenario-2: OSPF neighbor down due to incorrect OSPF network type
For scenario two, we'll break OSPF by misconfiguring the network type on cisco-rtr1's Tunnel0 interface. This creates a subtle failure where the OSPF neighbor goes down while the interface itself stays up. Therefore, our AI prompt must be more detailed to account for this protocol-level issue, not just a simple interface status change.

If Network type Point-to-Point is not configure it will correct the configuration.

💡 **Note**: In some cases, you may still see OSPF neighbor output even after changing the hello timer. This can happen if the OSPF adjacency hasn't fully timed out yet (dead interval is typically 40 seconds). If you see neighbor output, wait a few moments and check again. The neighbor state should eventually transition to down once the dead timer expires.

== Summary

This Lab successfully implemented a closed-loop, AI-driven network automation workflow. We began by integrating Cisco OSPF monitoring with Splunk alerting. Subsequently, an Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) rulebook was configured to act on these alerts, establishing an operational feedback loop. This final module leveraged that loop to trigger an AI workflow, which dynamically generates a remediation playbook. This powerful new capability allowed us to successfully stage, test, and automate troubleshooting for three distinct OSPF failure scenarios. 

By leveraging Ansible Lightspeed, our network expert could focus on codifying their troubleshooting knowledge in plain language, rather than getting bogged down in low-level syntax like playbook conditionals, operators, or regular expressions. This same process could easily be leveraged to iterate additional trouble shooting scenarios into the same playbook or refactored as roles.

== Congratulations! You've Completed Part 2!
