= Section 5 - Network Workflow
The workflow used in this Lab is called the **Network-AIOps-Workflow**. This workflow is triggered by 📡 Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) whenever an OSPF neighbor adjacency issue is detected by 🔍 Splunk. Specifically, this lab is set up to respond to failed OSPF neighbors. The workflow will run specific playbook tasks depending on the cause of the OSPF neighbor downtime.

== Scenarios
The essence of the following scenarios is to empower a network expert to translate their manual OSPF troubleshooting rationale into intelligent, automated playbooks. Using a development pipeline, the expert creates and refines prompts for 🧠 Ansible Lightspeed to generate the necessary automation code. To ensure safety and accuracy, a workflow allows the expert to first run each AI-generated playbook in check mode. This provides an opportunity to review and approve the proposed changes before they are applied to production. If a playbook doesn't work as intended, the expert can simply continue to refine their prompt in this iterative cycle until the desired outcome is achieved.

* Scenario-1: OSPF neighbor down due to interface shut 
* Scenario-2: OSPF neighbor down due to incorrect OSPF network type
* Scenario-3: OSPF neighbor down due to hello timer mismatch

== Scenario-1: OSPF neighbor down due to interface shut
In this first scenario we will cause an OSPF neighbor down by intentionally shut the OSPF interface (Tunnel0 on cisco-rtr1). 

Step 1: Review the playbook (aiops.yml) 
The playbook can be reviewed in its entirety here:

In the above playbook snippet the network engineer is articulating the requirements for the playbook as a multi-line variable named `lightspeed_prompt`. This portion of the prompt is focused on scenario-1. Here we are asking for a playbook to identify when the OSPF interface is down and remediate with a `no shut`

The tasks shown above were generated by Ansible Lightspeed in response to our prompt for remediating an OSPF down issue for scenario-1. The logic is straightforward: when a conditional task confirms the interface is administratively down, a subsequent task is run to re-enable it with the no shutdown command. The rest of the playbook has been truncated for brevity, as it pertains to later scenarios.

Step 5: Review the `lightspeed_response` playbook in the Gitea repository
You should see a recently updated file for lightspeed_response.yml in the lightspeed_playbooks repository. Now that this playbook is updated in the Gitea repo it becomes available to run in subsequent workflow steps.

== Scenario-2: OSPF neighbor down due to incorrect OSPF network type
For scenario two, we'll break OSPF by misconfiguring the network type on cisco-rtr1's Tunnel0 interface. This creates a subtle failure where the OSPF neighbor goes down while the interface itself stays up. Therefore, our AI prompt must be more detailed to account for this protocol-level issue, not just a simple interface status change.

== Summary

This Lab successfully implemented a closed-loop, AI-driven network automation workflow. We began by integrating Cisco OSPF monitoring with 🔍 Splunk alerting. Subsequently, an 📡 Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) rulebook was configured to act on these alerts, establishing an operational feedback loop. This final module leveraged that loop to trigger an AI workflow, which dynamically generates a remediation playbook. This powerful new capability allowed us to successfully stage, test, and automate troubleshooting for three distinct OSPF failure scenarios. 

By leveraging Ansible Lightspeed, our network expert could focus on codifying their troubleshooting knowledge in plain language, rather than getting bogged down in low-level syntax like playbook conditionals, operators, or regular expressions. This same process could easily be leveraged to iterate additional trouble shooting scenarios into the same playbook or refactored as roles.

== 🎉 Congratulations! You've Completed Part 2!
